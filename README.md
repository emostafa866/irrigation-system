# hints
- i created two entity one for plot of land and the other for seed and a model for irrigation period .
- may i didn't implment the best business logic , but it's my idea for agriculture so ..
- i made an enum class as a model related to each seed becoz i searched and knew that 
- every seed has four period to complete it's growth a
- each period has it's differnet amount of watter so
- i created a class in package util to calculate the amount of water for each one 
- according to service you should add your seed first 
- after when you register a land to ur system you should add it's seed firstly like each product should added to his category
